# leetcode
Doing LeetCode is a necessary evil if you're interested in becoming a software developer :(

The purpose of this repo is to store my leetcode solutions & guides for help in studying and tracking progress. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is inspired by [TJ Klint](https://github.com/tjklint)'s leetcode repo. I realized I'm wasting free time doomscrolling so why not use it to get better at coding while summer is around.
>
> When I am struggling on a problem, I will look to [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode) for help & tutorials.
